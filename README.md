# Yojimbo Scripts

AppleScripts for use with [Yojimbo](http://barebones.com/products/yojimbo/). Untested with Yojimbo 4 and mostly unmaintained for the past few years; however, pull requests with ready-to-go fixes or improvements are welcome. Intended to be installed in `~/Library/Scripts/Applications/Yojimbo/` and invoked with a script runner such as [FastScripts](http://www.red-sweater.com/fastscripts/) (or however you prefer to invoke scripts).

Most scripts contain a description or at least a link to a blog post that contains a description.

See also [yj2pwsafe](https://github.com/anoved/yj2pwsafe/), a script to import password or serial number items exported from Yojimbo to a Password Safe-compatible database.
